The goal is to build a robust and efficient solution designed to minimize latency and overhead through a custom protocol in a lean server environment. This project provides a foundational game server structure optimized for self-hosting, ensuring smooth and responsive multiplayer experiences.

## Current Functionality

- **FastAPI API**: A scalable and high-performance API built with FastAPI, handling routes for lobbies and player management.
- **Initial Unit Tests (partial pass)**: A scalable and high-performance API built with FastAPI, handling routes for lobbies and player management.
- **Custom UDP**: Initial roughdraft.

## Test-Driven Development Workflow

This project follows a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach, ensuring that all features are thoroughly tested and validated before implementation. This workflow enhances code reliability, facilitates refactoring, and accelerates development by catching issues early in the development cycle.

### Running Tests Locally
