    # Since no player endpoints are defined, we're adding placeholders
    # Update these tests when the actual endpoints are implemented
    # Example:
    # response = client.post("/players/create", params={"player_id": "player1"})
    # assert response.status_code == 200
    pass  # Remove this pass statement when adding actual tests
